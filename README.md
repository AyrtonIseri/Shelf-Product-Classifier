# Shelf-Product-Classifier
Using CV tactics to evaluate OSA (On-Shelf-Availability) of predetermined SKUs (olive oil) on proprietary dataset

## Required Libs:

  - Numpy
  
  - Pandas
  
  - Torch
  
  - Label-studio
  
## Setup
```
$ git clone https://github.com/AyrtonIseri/Shelf-Product-Classifier.git
$ cd Shelf-Product-Classifier
$ pip install requirements.txt
```
 
Note: This is the CM-203 - Computer Vision class final exam. Therefore, we will not apply as much effort in capturing and labeling dataset images as a real-life project might require. 

Nonetheless, the group will seek maximum precision regardless of the time and resource constraint under final exams.
